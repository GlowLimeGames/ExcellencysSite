        <b><p>You have just been appointed head cook for a medieval noble household poised to take the political scene by storm.
        This is the perfect time to show off your culinary genius. You will make culinary masterpieces copied across Europe.
        You will create feasts to impress and fill the greatest in the land.
        You will manipulate the great and powerful for the benefit of your house, or perhaps yourself.
        You will, that is, if you can keep the fish from burning.
        And if the meat course gets out before Lord Marquart finishes his tirade.
        Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, what is that fool there doing with the carving knife?
        Whereâ€™s Gregory when you need him?
        <br>
        Feel challenged as you work to earn the lord's favor.
        Can you get the dish out on time?</p>
