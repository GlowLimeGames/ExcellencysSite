	<div id="lowerText">
<p>In creating <em>His Excellency's Chef</em>, we wanted to make a cooking game with a creative style. We wanted it to be grand, exciting, and tense.</p>

<p>In medieval history, we found the perfect setting. What more grand and exciting context for a cooking game than a feast served before nobles? And, while we're at it, why not try to portray the social history we're dealing with relatively accurately, such that players can learn while playing?.</p>

<p>These are the aims that guided the development of <em>Chef&nbsp;</em> from the beginning. To make the game more creatively-oriented, we've focused gameplay away from executing recipes precisely, and instead given you a historically-relevant goal to achieve (balanced flavors) and ingredients with which to achieve it how you want.</p>

<p>We also abstracted the act of cooking an ingredient to timers so we could focus on good feedback on the resulting dish rather than the process of making it. We introduced commandable underlings to emphasize the management challenges inherent in cooking for a lot of people. We did research so that players could walk away from our mechanics understanding not just how to play the game, but also some of how medieval cooks saw food.</p>

<p>With these ideas, we believe we've made an enjoyable, creative, historical cooking game.</p>

<p>- Jonathan K-Q, Creative Director</p>
